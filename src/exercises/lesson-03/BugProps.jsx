/*
  BUG #3 — Props Not Updating

  This component displays a message based on a prop and includes
  a button that should change that message.

  Right now, the message is being stored in a way that React does not track,
  so the UI does not update when the value changes.

  Use the commented "Explanation" section at the bottom of this lesson's components.

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function BugProps({ name = 'friend' }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(`Hello, ${name}`);

  function handleChange() {
    setMessage(`Hi, ${name} !`);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{message}</p>
      <button onClick={handleChange}>Change Greeting</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
// The default reference to the name variable was invalid because it is JavaScript and so brackets are needed around the variable
//in addition to this it is important to use useState in order for React to be able to track the changes and
//correctly utilie the handleChange function
